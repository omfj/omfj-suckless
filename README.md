# OMFJ Suckless

My fork of dwm and dwmblocks with a few patches applied. You can see the patches in the `dwm/patches/` folder.

## Dependencies

### dwm

I use Fedora 36, so I had to download this...

```bash
dmenu libX11-devel libXft-devel libXinerama-devel xorg-x11-xinit-session
```

### dwmblocks

```bash
pamixer (or amxier) brightnessctl
```
